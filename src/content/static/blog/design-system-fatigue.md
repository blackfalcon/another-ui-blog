# Design system fatigue

Like most of my blog posts, it usually starts with a Tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To my design system folks,<br>Have you ever faced design system fatigue? If so, how did you deal with it?<br><br>After working in the space for while, I feel like my passion for it is slowly slipping away.</p>&mdash; Adekunle Oduye (@adekunleoduye) <auro-hyperlink target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/adekunleoduye/status/1382720128891170819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2021</auro-hyperlink></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Are you burnt out?

IMHO, design system fatigue is really the same as good old burnout. Burnout is a huge topic in this industry. Why do we have so much of it? Why is it so hard to recover from? What can we do to avoid it? Typical signs of being burnt out are disengagement, detached emotions, hopelessness, loss of motivation, depression, and the huge emotional toll of it all.

> Common causes of burnout include: lack of adequate social support; taking on more than one can handle at work, school, or interpersonally with family and friends; and poor self-care.

But what leads us to these feelings of fatigue or becoming burnt out? Well, Adekunle followed up his Tweet with the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good question! I think it might be several reasons but the top three would be:<br><br>1. Having a good balance between proactive and reactive work<br>2. Alignment on DS vision from management to IC level<br>3. Limited resource allocations for DS</p>&mdash; Adekunle Oduye (@adekunleoduye) <auro-hyperlink target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/adekunleoduye/status/1382750003572002819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2021</auro-hyperlink></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He nails it. What is also interesting is the order in which he lists the issues. I'd argue that if you flip the order, what you then have is essentially a list of cause and effect. Let's git into these one-by-one.

## Limited resource allocations for the design system

Design systems within any org is a real challenge, and you better be up to the task if you are willing taking this role on. They are odd ducks in any org because the person usually leading the charge is comfortable in both design and coding. So, where do you sit in the org? Again, most orgs have engineers and designers. Simple 1 and 0 categorizations. But when you cross both disciplines, where do you stand? I have personally have had issues with this. When speaking with some engineers they call me a 'designer'. When talking with some designers, they call me an 'engineer'. That aside, the point is how successful you are in this role is having the correct leadership around you.

To add to this confusion, most orgs will not correctly staff this effort. They will rely on one really motivated go-getter to really get this effort started. Sure, for a while you can make this work, but after time cracks will start to appear. Truth is, if you are strong enough to take on a challenge like this alone, you are also really good at hiding the stress you are under. If the project becomes more successful, more people will depend on you. The more people depend on you, the more effort you have to put into making the whole thing work. Then you quickly become the victim of your success. Leadership may look at you and be amazed as to what you have accomplished and not bat an eye at the fact that you are either a very small team or one person doing it alone. Because of that, it's hard as hell to get additional resources.

This is where it starts to get hard. I mean really hard. From what I have learned that to get help, you have to be vulnerable and sometimes fail. It's only then that you may get some key people to understand the stress you are under and you can ask for help. Leading up to and not taking this step is a HUGE cause of burnout. You become disengaged. Others may say that you are cold and emotionless. You will have feelings of hopelessness. And in the end, you will lose all sense of motivation and boom, burnt out.

## Alignment on design system vision from management to individual contributor level

This is a tough one. This is where limited team resources really start to have an impact on how you engage with the business. Leadership support of design systems is probably the most important thing when it comes to success. I have personally been on many teams that either was building a design system by simply being scrappy and treating it like a side-hustle, or on a team where there was leadership support, but only for the first release. After that, no dice.

Either way, if you have a lack of resources and a lack of leadership support, you are in a bad place and you need to really take a hard look at your situation.

If from an IC perspective there is the vision of a huge system that will have an impact on the whole org for years to come and leadership is not seeing that value prop and are simply waiting for the first release, then you will become very disenfranchised over time. This lack of support, the lack of simple acknowledgment from managers and peers will undoubtedly lead to burnout. Why do you deal with the stress of this work day-in and day-out when no one cares? When your own boss doesn't care? That's a bad place.

Aside from this, I should note that if by chance you do have alignment from leadership to IC, that in itself is extremely rewarding. Having someone in your corner to help fight your battles is invigorating and can help you get over the hurdle of limited resources. Now, all the things I say that come with limited resource allocation for the design system team are true, but even a small team with a manager that really believes in what you are doing will help you weather that storm, but not forever.

## Having a good balance between proactive and reactive work

Having the ability to be proactive and plan out new work, updates, or training with designers and engineers, all relies on adoption. The more a team adopts the design system, the more likely they are to positively engage with the design system team. This early engagement gives the design system team the ability to be proactive. The more that product teams are slow to adopt and become users who mainly engage when they need something right away, the more the design system team will always be in a reactive state of engagement.

> 'Will you adopt the system?' And I'm asking the team. I'm not asking the designer. I'm not asking the engineer. To be honest, I'm really looking at the product manager. 'Will you adopt this thing?' Let the silence seep into the room.

Team adoption of a design system and full engagement with product leadership is the key to success. What is life like without full product support? It's pretty easy to imagine. Product works with the team to deliver business value. The team works on coming up with a solution to the business request. Designers may work within the _scope_ of the design system, but when handing off to engineers, it is assumed that the engineers will address any design system needs. Sure, within that team, there may be engineers who are sympathetic to the design system and will engage, but their window of opportunity is very limited. _"Hey, we need this by the end of this sprint. So..."_

Let's flip the script. What does it look like to be proactive? This requires more engagement from product and full team adoption of the design system. That being said, the same things apply. Business communicates to product. Product communicates to the team. The team understands the problem. But what makes this different here is that the design system is included in all the conversations.

1. What from the design system will we be using?
1. Given that answer, what so we need to create new?
1. Out of that, what are opportunities to contribute to the design system, or where can the design system team assist?

It's here that the product team is actively engaging with the design system team to evaluate opportunities. With this scenario, the design system team comes away from that conversation with a relative understanding of what the product team's expectations will be and can proactively plan for that. Living in a world without proactive engagement from your customers means that you will always be reacting to their immediate needs.
