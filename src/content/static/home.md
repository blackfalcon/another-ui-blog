This is my blog, so I am not going to beat around the bush much. The fact is, [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) have been a dream for close to 15 years. Unlike many in web development, I have been watching the evolution of custom elements the whole time. Seeing their value without hesitation, I have simply been waiting for the tech to catch up to the dream.
