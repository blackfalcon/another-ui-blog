What we have always wanted is a way to make super-powered HTML elements so that we can make awesome things. Custom elements give us that in a way that is so amazing.

Unlike many in web development, I have been watching the evolution of custom elements the whole time. Seeing their value without hesitation, I have simply been waiting for the tech to catch up to the dream.
