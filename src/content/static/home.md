If you are like me you may be experiencing burnout from all the drama in the world. It's at times like this that we need to find things that make us happy. Reduces the stresses of the world and is just simply fund to do.

For me, that is building a HTML custom element that solves one of the great trivialities of the world, but a necessary tool to bridge the gaps between the current state of the internet and perceived performance. And they are just fun to build. Yes, I am talking about SPINNERS!

Let's just say, it all started with a Tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HTML should have a &lt;num&gt; tag that formats numbers according to the user&#39;s locale without JavaScript.</p>&mdash; Justin Fagnani (@justinfagnani) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1321909445685731328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This sparked a discussion I had with another developer about the number of times there were date and time conversion functions in the many web properties our teams manage. Let's just say, more than one is too many.

So blah blah ... custom elements or web components. You get it. They are here and we can use them. Why do you care?

Simple really. Web development is all about HTML, right? But it's crazy how much effort we put in to not use HTML. Yes, it's primitive af. I get that. What we have always wanted is a way to make super-powered HTML elements so that we can make awesome things. Custom elements give us that in a way that is so amazing.

This is my blog, so I am not going to beat around the bush much. The fact is, [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) have been a dream for close to 15 years. Unlike many in web development, I have been watching the evolution of custom elements the whole time. Seeing their value without hesitation, I have simply been waiting for the tech to catch up to the dream.

This week challenged me with the age 'ole question of how to deal with hover events and touch devices. When @media queries fail, what next?
